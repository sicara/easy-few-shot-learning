    "# Train a model with Classical Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Although episodic training has attracted a lot of interest in the early years of Few-Shot Learning research, more recent works suggest that competitive results can be achieved with a simple cross entropy loss across all training classes. Therefore, it is becoming more and more common to use this classical process to train the backbone, that will be common to all methods compared at test time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is in fact more representative of real use cases: episodic training assumes that, at training time, you have access to the shape of the few-shot tasks that will be encountered at test time (indeed you choose a specific number of ways for episodic training). You also \"force\" your inference method into the training of the network. Switching the few-shot learning logic to inference (i.e. no episodic training) allows methods to be agnostic of the backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, if you need to perform episodic training, we also provide [an example notebook](episodic_training.ipynb) for that."
